MAIN Mastering AI Network AI Education Events for Small
Businesses & Trades BUSINESS PLAN February 2026 CONFIDENTIAL

1.  Executive Summary MAIN (Mastering AI Network) is an
    events-based business that teaches small businesses, tradespeople,
    and professional service providers how to use artificial
    intelligence to improve their business performance. Modelled on the
    success of industry networks like PIN (Property Investment Network),
    MAIN delivers trade-specific, hands-on AI education through
    affordable, locally-hosted evening events across the UK. The first
    event will target plumbers in London, offering a 2-3 hour evening
    session combining live AI workshops, networking, and practical
    demonstrations. Tickets will be priced at £10-£20 to minimise
    barriers to entry and maximise attendance. The long-term vision is
    to scale across multiple trades, professions, and UK cities ---
    creating the go-to brand for practical AI adoption in the SME and
    trades sector. Key Metrics at a Glance

2.  The Opportunity AI adoption among UK small businesses and
    tradespeople is still in its infancy. While large enterprises invest
    heavily in AI transformation, the 5.5 million small businesses in
    the UK are largely being left behind. Most tradespeople and small
    business owners know AI exists but have no idea how to practically
    apply it to their day-to-day operations. They are not looking for
    theory --- they want someone to show them exactly which tools to use
    and how to set them up. The gap in the market is clear: there are
    plenty of AI courses aimed at tech professionals and corporates, but
    virtually nothing designed for plumbers, electricians, estate
    agents, accountants, and other small business operators. MAIN fills
    this gap by delivering practical, jargon-free, trade-specific AI
    education in a familiar networking event format. Why Now? AI tools
    have become affordable and accessible --- most are free or under
    £30/month, making them viable for sole traders and small teams.
    Tradespeople are time-poor and learn best by doing --- a hands-on
    workshop format is far more effective than online courses they will
    never complete. Competitors offering AI training to SMEs are focused
    on SaaS sales, not genuine education. MAIN is vendor-neutral and
    outcome-focused. The networking element adds value beyond education
    --- tradespeople value peer connections and referral opportunities.

3.  Target Market MAIN targets small business owners and professionals
    who rely on their own effort and time to run their business and who
    would benefit most from AI-driven productivity gains. The initial
    focus is on trades, with expansion into professional services. Phase
    1: Trades (Months 1-6) Plumbers, electricians, builders, painters
    and decorators, HVAC engineers, landscapers, and other construction
    and maintenance trades. These businesses typically have 1-10
    employees, spend significant time on quoting, scheduling, and
    customer communication, and have little to no AI knowledge. Phase 2:
    Professional Services (Months 6-12) Estate agents, letting agents,
    property managers, independent accountants, bookkeepers, mortgage
    brokers, insurance brokers, and small legal firms. These professions
    are document-heavy and client-facing, making them ideal candidates
    for AI-powered automation. Phase 3: Broader SMEs (Year 2+) Retail
    shop owners, salon and beauty businesses, fitness studios,
    restaurants, recruitment agencies, and other local businesses. By
    this stage, MAIN will have a proven playbook and brand recognition
    to enter any SME vertical.

4.  Event Format & Structure Each MAIN event follows a consistent format
    designed to maximise practical learning and networking value within
    a 2.5-hour evening slot. The format is inspired by successful
    networking events like PIN but with a strong educational and
    workshop component. Sample Agenda: Plumbers in London

The first event will focus on the two highest-value AI use cases for
plumbers: quoting and invoicing, and customer communications. Remaining
topics (finding leads, scheduling, bookkeeping, and marketing) become
content for future events --- creating a natural reason for repeat
attendance.

5.  Financial Plan First Event Budget

Revenue Scenarios (First Event)

Even in the conservative scenario, the event breaks even or turns a
small profit. The target scenario delivers a healthy margin of £150-£425
profit. Speaker costs are zero as guest speakers participate for
exposure, networking value, and the opportunity to position themselves
as thought leaders in their trade. Year 1 Revenue Projection Assuming a
ramp from 1 event per month to 3-4 events per month by month 12, with
gradual ticket price increases as the brand establishes credibility,
Year 1 projected revenue is £12,000-£25,000 from ticket sales alone.
This does not include potential sponsorship income, which could add
30-50% once audience size and brand recognition justify sponsor
interest.

6.  Marketing & Go-to-Market Strategy With a limited budget, MAIN's
    go-to-market strategy relies on organic reach, community engagement,
    and strategic partnerships. The goal is to sell 30-50 tickets within
    4-6 weeks for the first event. Channel Strategy Social Media
    (Organic) Create dedicated MAIN accounts on LinkedIn, Facebook,
    Instagram, and TikTok. Post short-form content demonstrating AI wins
    for tradespeople: before/after quoting speeds, automated customer
    reply demos, and testimonial-style clips. Target 2-3 posts per week
    in the lead-up to the event. LinkedIn is particularly valuable for
    reaching trade business owners who are actively looking to grow.
    Facebook & LinkedIn Groups Join and actively contribute to plumbing
    and trade groups on Facebook and LinkedIn. Provide genuine value by
    answering questions and sharing AI tips before promoting the event.
    Key groups include UK Plumbers Forum, Plumbing & Heating Engineers
    UK, and trade-specific LinkedIn communities. Be transparent about
    the event --- tradespeople respect directness. Trade Associations &
    Suppliers Approach plumbing merchants (Toolstation, Screwfix, City
    Plumbing, Plumbase) and trade associations (CIPHE, Gas Safe Register
    community) about cross-promotion. Offer them a mention at the event
    or a small number of complimentary tickets in exchange for promoting
    to their customer base via email or in-store flyers. Plumbing
    merchants have direct access to exactly the audience MAIN needs.
    Eventbrite SEO & Discovery Optimise the Eventbrite listing with
    keywords tradespeople might search: "AI for plumbers", "plumbing
    business growth", "trade networking London". Eventbrite has its own
    discovery algorithm and many tradespeople browse it for local
    networking and training events. Launch Timeline (6 Weeks to Event)

7.  Scaling Strategy MAIN is designed to scale in three dimensions:
    across trades and professions, across locations, and across revenue
    streams. The playbook for each event is repeatable --- only the
    trade-specific content changes. Scaling Across Trades After proving
    the model with plumbers, MAIN expands to electricians, builders, and
    other trades using the same event format. Each trade gets its own
    tailored content: electricians learn AI for compliance documentation
    and safety certificates; estate agents learn AI for property
    descriptions and lead nurturing; accountants learn AI for
    bookkeeping automation and client reporting. The workshop content is
    customised, but the event infrastructure remains identical. Scaling
    Across Locations Starting in London, MAIN expands to Birmingham,
    Manchester, Bristol, Leeds, and other major UK cities. Each new city
    launch follows the same 6-week go-to-market playbook. Venue costs
    outside London are typically lower, improving margins. Local guest
    speakers and trade contacts are sourced for each city to maintain
    authenticity and credibility. Future Revenue Streams Sponsorship: AI
    tool vendors (e.g., Jobber, ServiceM8, Tradify) pay to sponsor
    events or demo their products. Target £200-£500 per event sponsor
    once audience reaches 40+. Membership/Community: A paid online
    community (£5-£15/month) offering ongoing AI tips, tool discounts,
    and access to recorded workshops. Affiliate Income: Referral
    commissions from AI tool providers when attendees sign up for
    recommended software. Premium Workshops: Full-day or half-day
    deep-dive workshops priced at £50-£150 for intensive, hands-on AI
    implementation. Corporate/Group Bookings: Companies booking MAIN to
    train their entire team, priced as a day rate.

8.  Competitive Advantage MAIN's competitive moat is built on four
    pillars that are difficult for competitors to replicate quickly:
    Trade-Specific Content: Generic AI training is everywhere.
    Trade-specific, practical AI training does not exist at scale. A
    plumber does not care about enterprise AI strategy --- they care
    about sending quotes faster and getting more Google reviews. MAIN
    speaks their language. Hands-On Format: Attendees do not just watch
    a presentation --- they open their phones and laptops and follow
    along. They leave the event with tools actually set up and working.
    This creates immediate value and powerful word-of-mouth. Networking
    Value: The PIN model proves that tradespeople and business owners
    will pay to be in a room with peers. The networking element alone
    justifies the ticket price for many attendees. AI education is the
    bonus. Vendor-Neutral Trust: MAIN recommends the best tools, not the
    ones paying the highest commission. This builds trust and long-term
    audience loyalty. Sponsorship relationships are transparent and
    never compromise content quality.
