MAIN

Making AI Intuitive for Networks

AI Education Events for Small Businesses & Trades

BUSINESS PLAN

February 2026

CONFIDENTIAL

1.  Executive Summary

MAIN (Making AI Intuitive for Networks) is an events-based business that
teaches small businesses, tradespeople, and professional service
providers how to use artificial intelligence to improve their business
performance. Modelled on the success of industry networks like PIN
(Property Investment Network), MAIN delivers trade-specific, hands-on AI
education through affordable, locally-hosted evening events across the
UK.

The first event will target plumbers in London, offering a 2-3 hour
evening session combining live AI workshops, networking, and practical
demonstrations. Tickets will be priced at £10-£20 to minimise barriers
to entry and maximise attendance. The long-term vision is to scale
across multiple trades, professions, and UK cities --- creating the
go-to brand for practical AI adoption in the SME and trades sector.

Key Metrics at a Glance

2.  The Opportunity

AI adoption among UK small businesses and tradespeople is still in its
infancy. While large enterprises invest heavily in AI transformation,
the 5.5 million small businesses in the UK are largely being left
behind. Most tradespeople and small business owners know AI exists but
have no idea how to practically apply it to their day-to-day operations.
They are not looking for theory --- they want someone to show them
exactly which tools to use and how to set them up.

The gap in the market is clear: there are plenty of AI courses aimed at
tech professionals and corporates, but virtually nothing designed for
plumbers, electricians, estate agents, accountants, and other small
business operators. MAIN fills this gap by delivering practical,
jargon-free, trade-specific AI education in a familiar networking event
format.

Why Now?

AI tools have become affordable and accessible --- most are free or
under £30/month, making them viable for sole traders and small teams.

Tradespeople are time-poor and learn best by doing --- a hands-on
workshop format is far more effective than online courses they will
never complete.

Competitors offering AI training to SMEs are focused on SaaS sales, not
genuine education. MAIN is vendor-neutral and outcome-focused.

The networking element adds value beyond education --- tradespeople
value peer connections and referral opportunities.

3.  Target Market

MAIN targets small business owners and professionals who rely on their
own effort and time to run their business and who would benefit most
from AI-driven productivity gains. The initial focus is on trades, with
expansion into professional services.

Phase 1: Trades (Months 1-6)

Plumbers, electricians, builders, painters and decorators, HVAC
engineers, landscapers, and other construction and maintenance trades.
These businesses typically have 1-10 employees, spend significant time
on quoting, scheduling, and customer communication, and have little to
no AI knowledge.

Phase 2: Professional Services (Months 6-12)

Estate agents, letting agents, property managers, independent
accountants, bookkeepers, mortgage brokers, insurance brokers, and small
legal firms. These professions are document-heavy and client-facing,
making them ideal candidates for AI-powered automation.

Phase 3: Broader SMEs (Year 2+)

Retail shop owners, salon and beauty businesses, fitness studios,
restaurants, recruitment agencies, and other local businesses. By this
stage, MAIN will have a proven playbook and brand recognition to enter
any SME vertical.

4.  Event Format & Structure

Each MAIN event follows a consistent format designed to maximise
practical learning and networking value within a 2.5-hour evening slot.
The format is inspired by successful networking events like PIN but with
a strong educational and workshop component.

Sample Agenda: Plumbers in London

The first event will focus on the two highest-value AI use cases for
plumbers: quoting and invoicing, and customer communications. Remaining
topics (finding leads, scheduling, bookkeeping, and marketing) become
content for future events --- creating a natural reason for repeat
attendance.

5.  Financial Plan

First Event Budget

Revenue Scenarios (First Event)

Even in the conservative scenario, the event breaks even or turns a
small profit. The target scenario delivers a healthy margin of £150-£425
profit. Speaker costs are zero as guest speakers participate for
exposure, networking value, and the opportunity to position themselves
as thought leaders in their trade.

Year 1 Revenue Projection

Assuming a ramp from 1 event per month to 3-4 events per month by month
12, with gradual ticket price increases as the brand establishes
credibility, Year 1 projected revenue is £12,000-£25,000 from ticket
sales alone. This does not include potential sponsorship income, which
could add 30-50% once audience size and brand recognition justify
sponsor interest.

6.  Marketing & Go-to-Market Strategy

With a limited budget, MAIN's go-to-market strategy relies on organic
reach, community engagement, and strategic partnerships. The goal is to
sell 30-50 tickets within 4-6 weeks for the first event.

Channel Strategy

Social Media (Organic)

Create dedicated MAIN accounts on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and
TikTok. Post short-form content demonstrating AI wins for tradespeople:
before/after quoting speeds, automated customer reply demos, and
testimonial-style clips. Target 2-3 posts per week in the lead-up to the
event. LinkedIn is particularly valuable for reaching trade business
owners who are actively looking to grow.

Facebook & LinkedIn Groups

Join and actively contribute to plumbing and trade groups on Facebook
and LinkedIn. Provide genuine value by answering questions and sharing
AI tips before promoting the event. Key groups include UK Plumbers
Forum, Plumbing & Heating Engineers UK, and trade-specific LinkedIn
communities. Be transparent about the event --- tradespeople respect
directness.

Trade Associations & Suppliers

Approach plumbing merchants (Toolstation, Screwfix, City Plumbing,
Plumbase) and trade associations (CIPHE, Gas Safe Register community)
about cross-promotion. Offer them a mention at the event or a small
number of complimentary tickets in exchange for promoting to their
customer base via email or in-store flyers. Plumbing merchants have
direct access to exactly the audience MAIN needs.

Eventbrite SEO & Discovery

Optimise the Eventbrite listing with keywords tradespeople might search:
"AI for plumbers", "plumbing business growth", "trade networking
London". Eventbrite has its own discovery algorithm and many
tradespeople browse it for local networking and training events.

Launch Timeline (6 Weeks to Event)

7.  Scaling Strategy

MAIN is designed to scale in three dimensions: across trades and
professions, across locations, and across revenue streams. The playbook
for each event is repeatable --- only the trade-specific content
changes.

Scaling Across Trades

After proving the model with plumbers, MAIN expands to electricians,
builders, and other trades using the same event format. Each trade gets
its own tailored content: electricians learn AI for compliance
documentation and safety certificates; estate agents learn AI for
property descriptions and lead nurturing; accountants learn AI for
bookkeeping automation and client reporting. The workshop content is
customised, but the event infrastructure remains identical.

Scaling Across Locations

Starting in London, MAIN expands to Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol,
Leeds, and other major UK cities. Each new city launch follows the same
6-week go-to-market playbook. Venue costs outside London are typically
lower, improving margins. Local guest speakers and trade contacts are
sourced for each city to maintain authenticity and credibility.

Future Revenue Streams

Sponsorship: AI tool vendors (e.g., Jobber, ServiceM8, Tradify) pay to
sponsor events or demo their products. Target £200-£500 per event
sponsor once audience reaches 40+.

Membership/Community: A paid online community (£5-£15/month) offering
ongoing AI tips, tool discounts, and access to recorded workshops.

Affiliate Income: Referral commissions from AI tool providers when
attendees sign up for recommended software.

Premium Workshops: Full-day or half-day deep-dive workshops priced at
£50-£150 for intensive, hands-on AI implementation.

Corporate/Group Bookings: Companies booking MAIN to train their entire
team, priced as a day rate.

8.  Membership Model

Beyond individual event tickets, MAIN offers a three-tier membership
structure designed to create recurring revenue, deepen community
engagement, and provide ongoing value between events. Memberships should
be launched after the second or third event, once attendees have
experienced the MAIN format and are ready to commit to ongoing learning.

Starter (Free)

The Starter tier is a free entry point for anyone who has attended a
MAIN event and wants to stay connected. It costs nothing to run and
serves as the top of the membership funnel, keeping attendees warm
between events and building the email list.

Weekly MAIN newsletter with AI tips, tool updates, and event
announcements

10% discount on all MAIN event tickets

Access to the MAIN public resource page (basic AI tool directory with
links and descriptions)

Early access to event announcements (book before the general public)

Access to the MAIN LinkedIn and Facebook community group

Pro --- £15/month

The Pro tier is the volume membership, designed as a no-brainer upgrade
for anyone who attends events regularly. The included free event ticket
nearly covers the monthly cost on its own, making everything else feel
like a bonus. This tier is where the WhatsApp community and workshop
recordings drive the most retention.

Everything in Starter, plus:

One free MAIN event ticket per month (worth £10-£20)

Access to the private WhatsApp community group (peer support, share
wins, ask questions, get real-time help)

Full library of workshop recordings (every past event recorded and
uploaded)

Downloadable AI tool cheat sheets and step-by-step setup guides
(trade-specific)

Monthly group Q&A call (30-60 minutes, live on Zoom, members submit
questions in advance)

Exclusive AI tool discount codes and deals (negotiated with tool
providers)

Priority seating at events (guaranteed spot even when events sell out)

Member-only content drops (short video tutorials, prompt templates, and
automation walkthroughs sent monthly)

Elite --- £45/month

The Elite tier is the high-value, low-volume offering for business
owners who want personalised, hands-on AI implementation support. This
tier should be capped at 20-30 members initially to protect delivery
quality and the host's time. Even at 20 members, this tier generates
£10,800 per year in recurring revenue.

Everything in Pro, plus:

Unlimited free access to all MAIN events (any trade, any city --- no
ticket costs ever)

One 1-2-1 mentorship session per month (30 minutes, focused on their
specific business --- setting up tools, reviewing workflows, solving
problems)

Personalised AI action plan (on joining, a tailored 90-day AI
implementation roadmap based on their business)

Access to a private Elite WhatsApp group (smaller, higher-quality group
with direct access to the host and other serious implementers)

Guest speaker replay library with bonus Q&A content (extended interviews
not shown at the public event)

Quarterly business review call (15-minute check-in every 3 months to
review AI progress and set new goals)

"Implemented" badge and case study opportunity (featured on MAIN's
website and social media as an AI leader in their trade)

Early beta access to new MAIN offerings (courses, premium workshops,
partnerships)

Bring a mate free to any event (one guest pass per month --- also feeds
the acquisition pipeline)

Tier Comparison

Membership Revenue Projection (Year 1)

Assuming memberships launch after month 3 and grow steadily through
event attendance conversion, a conservative Year 1 target of 50 Pro
members and 15 Elite members by month 12 would generate approximately
£17,100 in annual recurring revenue (£9,000 from Pro + £8,100 from
Elite). Combined with ticket sales of £12,000-£25,000, total Year 1
revenue potential rises to £29,000-£42,000 before sponsorship or
affiliate income.

9.  Competitive Advantage

MAIN's competitive moat is built on four pillars that are difficult for
competitors to replicate quickly:

Trade-Specific Content: Generic AI training is everywhere.
Trade-specific, practical AI training does not exist at scale. A plumber
does not care about enterprise AI strategy --- they care about sending
quotes faster and getting more Google reviews. MAIN speaks their
language.

Hands-On Format: Attendees do not just watch a presentation --- they
open their phones and laptops and follow along. They leave the event
with tools actually set up and working. This creates immediate value and
powerful word-of-mouth.

Networking Value: The PIN model proves that tradespeople and business
owners will pay to be in a room with peers. The networking element alone
justifies the ticket price for many attendees. AI education is the
bonus.

Vendor-Neutral Trust: MAIN recommends the best tools, not the ones
paying the highest commission. This builds trust and long-term audience
loyalty. Sponsorship relationships are transparent and never compromise
content quality.
