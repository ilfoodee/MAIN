## 1. Brand Overview

### Mission

MAIN exists to make artificial intelligence accessible, practical, and immediately useful for small businesses, tradespeople, startup founders, and aspiring app builders across the UK. We bridge the gap between expensive enterprise AI consulting and generic online courses by delivering hands-on, trade-specific education through affordable evening workshops.

### Brand Essence

MAIN is where working professionals come to learn AI by doing. Not by watching. Not by reading. By opening their laptops and leaving with tools that are set up, configured, and working.

### Brand Values

**Practical over theoretical.** Every session ends with something tangible. Attendees leave with tools installed and working, not just slides to revisit.

**Vendor-neutral trust.** We recommend the best tools for the job, not the ones paying the highest commission. Our credibility is our most valuable asset.

**Jargon-free clarity.** We speak the language of our audience. No enterprise buzzwords, no intimidating technical jargon, no unnecessary complexity.

**Community-first.** The networking value of being in a room with peers is as important as the education itself. We build networks, not just audiences.

### Brand Personality

MAIN should feel like a knowledgeable, approachable friend who happens to be brilliant with AI — not a corporate trainer in a suit. The brand is confident without being arrogant, modern without being inaccessible, and premium without being exclusive. Think: trusted industry insider, not distant consultant.

## 2. Logo & Wordmark

### Primary Wordmark

The MAIN wordmark is the primary brand identifier. It uses the Outfit typeface at weight 900 (Black) with tight letter-spacing (-0.04em). The distinctive feature is the gradient-treated "AI" letterforms, which visually link the brand name to its core subject.

**Construction:** The letters "M" and "N" are rendered in solid colour (dark backgrounds: `#F1F5F9` off-white; light backgrounds: `#06080D` near-black). The letters "A" and "I" are rendered using the primary brand gradient (135° from `#4F8EF7` Electric Blue to `#34D399` Emerald Cyan).

### Minimum Size

The wordmark should never appear smaller than 24px in digital contexts or 10mm in print to maintain legibility of the gradient treatment on the AI letterforms.

### Clear Space

Maintain clear space equal to the height of the letter "M" around all sides of the wordmark. No other graphic elements, text, or visual distractions should enter this zone.

### Logo Variants

**Dark background (primary):** White M and N, gradient AI. Used on the dark navy backgrounds (`#06080D`) that define the MAIN digital experience.

**Light background:** Dark navy M and N (`#06080D`), gradient AI. Used on white or light grey backgrounds for print materials, documents, and light-mode contexts.

**Monochrome:** All white or all dark. Used only when colour reproduction is not possible (single-colour printing, embossing, engraving).

### Descriptor Line

The full descriptor "Mastering AI Network" appears beneath the wordmark in Newsreader italic at a reduced size. This is optional and should only be used when the audience may be unfamiliar with the brand.

## 3. Colour Palette

The MAIN colour system is built around a premium dark aesthetic with vibrant accent colours that convey technology, trust, and energy. The palette is derived directly from the website and digital brand presence.

### Primary Colours

| Swatch | Name | Hex | Usage |
|--------|------|-----|-------|
| 🟦 | **Deep Navy** | `#06080D` | Primary background. The signature MAIN canvas. |
| 🟦 | **Navy Elevated** | `#0C1017` | Cards, modals, elevated surfaces. |
| 🔵 | **Electric Blue** | `#4F8EF7` | Primary accent. CTAs, links, interactive elements. |
| 🔵 | **Blue Bright** | `#6BA1FF` | Hover states, highlighted text, active elements. |

### Secondary Colours

| Swatch | Name | Hex | Usage |
|--------|------|-----|-------|
| 🟢 | **Emerald Cyan** | `#34D399` | Success states, growth metrics, gradient endpoint. |
| 🟣 | **Violet** | `#8B5CF6` | Decorative accents, connector lines, tertiary actions. |
| 🟡 | **Amber** | `#FBBF24` | Warnings, attention markers, premium/featured tags. |

### Neutral Colours

| Swatch | Name | Hex | Usage |
|--------|------|-----|-------|
| ⬜ | **Off White** | `#F1F5F9` | Primary text on dark backgrounds. |
| ⬜ | **Slate** | `#94A3B8` | Secondary text, descriptions, captions. |
| ⬜ | **Muted Slate** | `#64748B` | Tertiary text, disabled states, metadata. |
| ⬜ | **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Headings on dark, high-contrast elements. |

### The Brand Gradient

The signature MAIN gradient runs at 135° from Electric Blue (`#4F8EF7`) to Emerald Cyan (`#34D399`). This gradient is used on the logo AI letterforms, primary CTAs on hover, section accent lines, and decorative elements. It should never be used as a full background fill — only for highlights, accents, and the wordmark.

### Colour Ratios

Dark surfaces (Deep Navy and Navy Elevated) should dominate at approximately 70–80% of any composition. Accent colours (Electric Blue, Emerald Cyan) should comprise 15–20%. Supporting colours (Violet, Amber) should be used sparingly at 5–10% maximum.

---

## 4. Typography

Typography is central to MAIN's brand identity. The type system balances modern geometric clarity with editorial warmth, creating a feel that is both technically credible and approachable.

### Font Families

| Font | Usage | Specimen |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Outfit** | Headings, UI, navigation, buttons, labels | The quick brown fox jumps |
| **Newsreader** | Descriptors, editorial italic accents, hero subtext | *The quick brown fox jumps* |

Outfit is a geometric sans-serif that provides clean, modern headings and UI elements. It is used across all weights from Light (300) to Black (900). Newsreader is a transitional serif used exclusively in italic for editorial flourishes — the hero tagline, section descriptors, and the brand descriptor line beneath the wordmark.

### Type Scale (Digital)

| Level | Spec |
|-------|------|
| **Hero heading** | `clamp(3.2rem, 5.5vw, 5rem)` — Outfit 900, letter-spacing -0.045em, line-height 1.02 |
| **Section heading** | `clamp(2.2rem, 4vw, 3.2rem)` — Outfit 800, letter-spacing -0.035em |
| **Subsection heading** | 1.1–1.3rem — Outfit 700, letter-spacing -0.01em |
| **Body text** | 0.95–1.15rem — Outfit 400, line-height 1.65–1.75, colour `#94A3B8` |
| **Labels & metadata** | 0.82–0.88rem — Outfit 500–600, letter-spacing 0.14em, uppercase |

### Print Fallbacks

When Outfit and Newsreader are unavailable, use Trebuchet MS as the sans-serif substitute and Georgia as the serif substitute. These are the closest widely-available system fonts and are used throughout MAIN print documents and this guidelines document.

## 5. Visual Language & Effects

MAIN's visual identity draws from a premium dark tech aesthetic. These signature effects create a cohesive, recognisable look across all digital touchpoints.

### Glassmorphism

Cards and elevated surfaces use a frosted glass treatment: semi-transparent backgrounds (`rgba(14, 18, 28, 0.6)`), backdrop blur at 24px with 180% saturation, and subtle 1px borders at `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06)`. This creates depth without heavy drop shadows.

**CSS pattern:**
```css
background: rgba(14, 18, 28, 0.6);
backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(180%);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);
```

### Aurora Gradient Backgrounds

Large sections use subtle, animated radial gradients that mimic aurora borealis. These are built from overlapping elliptical gradients using Electric Blue, Violet, and Emerald Cyan at very low opacity (0.04–0.08). The animation is slow and gentle (20-second cycles) to create atmosphere without distraction.

### Dot Matrix Pattern

A subtle dot grid overlay (1px dots at 32px spacing, `rgba(255,255,255,0.03)`) is layered over hero and feature sections. This adds texture to large dark surfaces and subtly references digital/data themes.

### Noise Texture

A fixed SVG fractal noise overlay at 2.5% opacity sits atop the entire page. This eliminates colour banding on large gradient areas and adds an analogue warmth to the digital aesthetic.

### Glow Effects

Interactive elements and key statistics use coloured glow effects on hover. These are implemented as blurred box-shadows or pseudo-element blurs. Blue glow uses `rgba(79, 142, 247, 0.15)`; cyan glow uses `rgba(52, 211, 153, 0.12)`. Glows should be soft and diffused (30–60px blur radius), never sharp or ring-like.

### Border Radius System

| Size | Value | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Small** | 10px | Buttons, tags, badges, input fields |
| **Medium** | 16px | Standard cards, dropdown menus, tooltips |
| **Large** | 24px | Feature cards, testimonial cards, image containers |
| **Extra Large** | 32px | Hero cards, stat blocks, prominent containers |

### Animation Principles

All animations use the `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` easing curve for a smooth, decelerating feel. Standard transition duration is 0.3–0.5 seconds for UI interactions. Scroll-triggered reveal animations use staggered delays (0.15s increments) to create cascading entrance effects. Animations should enhance comprehension and delight, never block interaction or delay content.

## 6. UI Components

### Buttons

**Primary:** Electric Blue (`#4F8EF7`) background, white text, Outfit 600, 14px border-radius, padding 17px 34px. Hover: Blue Bright (`#6BA1FF`), translateY(-2px), glow shadow.

**Secondary (Ghost):** Transparent background, 1px border `rgba(255,255,255,0.12)`, off-white text. Hover: background `rgba(255,255,255,0.04)`, lighter border.

**Arrow indicator:** Primary buttons include a "→" arrow that translates 4px right on hover, providing a micro-interaction cue.

### Cards

All cards use the glassmorphism treatment described in Section 5. Cards lift on hover (translateY -5px to -8px) with border colour transitioning from `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.12)`. Feature cards include a top-edge gradient line (2px height) using the brand gradient as a visual anchor.

### Navigation

The fixed navigation bar starts transparent and transitions to a frosted glass state (`rgba(6, 8, 13, 0.88)` with backdrop blur) on scroll. This transition uses the brand easing curve over 0.5 seconds. Nav links are Outfit 500 at 0.88rem in Muted Slate (`#64748B`), transitioning to Off White (`#F1F5F9`) on hover with a subtle surface-coloured background.

### Section Labels

Section eyebrows use a consistent pattern: a 40px gradient line (Electric Blue to Emerald Cyan) followed by uppercase text in Outfit 600, 0.82rem, letter-spacing 0.14em, coloured in Blue Bright (`#6BA1FF`). These anchor the viewer and create visual rhythm between sections.

### Hover Step Numbers

The three-step process uses circular containers (88px diameter) with a subtle border. On hover, the border colour transitions to Electric Blue and the number gains a soft blue glow (`box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(79, 142, 247, 0.15)`). A three-colour connector line (Blue → Violet → Cyan) runs between them.

## 7. Imagery & Iconography

### Photography Style

When photography is used, it should feature real working professionals in their actual environments — tradespeople on site, small business owners at their desks, founders collaborating. Images should feel authentic and unstaged. Avoid stock-photo aesthetics with overly bright lighting and forced smiles. A slight desaturated, cool-toned colour grade aligns with the brand palette.

### Iconography

Icons should be line-style with a 1.5–2px stroke weight, matching the clean, modern feel of the Outfit typeface. The recommended icon set is Lucide (lucide.dev) for its consistent geometry and open-source availability. Icons are rendered in Muted Slate (`#64748B`) by default, transitioning to Electric Blue (`#4F8EF7`) or Off White (`#F1F5F9`) on hover or active states.

### Emoji Usage

Emojis are used strategically in the learning topic cards and feature lists to add warmth and visual scanning cues. They serve as quick visual identifiers (e.g., a lightning bolt for quoting speed, a chart for analytics). Use them sparingly and consistently — one emoji per card or list item maximum. Never use emojis in headings, CTAs, or formal communications.

### Avatar Placeholders

Testimonial avatars use circular containers (44px) filled with the brand gradient, displaying initials in Outfit 700 at 0.9rem. This maintains visual consistency when photographs are unavailable and reinforces the gradient as a brand element.

## 8. Tone of Voice

### Voice Characteristics

**Direct and confident.** We don't hedge or overcomplicate. "You'll leave with tools working" not "We aim to provide you with the opportunity to explore tooling options."

**Warm but not casual.** We're friendly, but we're professionals talking to professionals. No slang, no forced humour, no exclamation-mark overload.

**Outcome-focused.** Always lead with what the audience gets. Time saved. Money earned. Quotes sent faster. Reviews collected automatically.

**Jargon-free.** If a plumber wouldn't say it in a van, don't put it in copy. "AI-powered quoting" is fine. "Leverage machine learning paradigms for estimate optimisation" is not.

### Writing Examples

#### Headlines

✅ **Do:** "Learn AI. Actually use it. Tonight."

❌ **Don't:** "Unlock the transformative potential of artificial intelligence for your enterprise!"

#### Descriptions

✅ **Do:** "Real tools. Set up and working before you leave the room."

❌ **Don't:** "Our comprehensive curriculum empowers participants with cutting-edge AI capabilities."

#### CTAs

✅ **Do:** "Find your next event →" / "Join the community" / "See what you'll learn"

❌ **Don't:** "Register now!" / "Submit" / "Click here to learn more"

### Audience-Specific Language

When writing for tradespeople, reference their daily realities: quoting jobs, chasing invoices, managing customer calls, getting Google reviews. For startup founders, reference shipping products, finding product-market fit, automating workflows. For app builders, reference prototyping, no-code tools, and turning ideas into MVPs. Always speak to their world, not ours.

## 9. Digital Applications

### Website

The MAIN website is the primary brand expression. It uses the full dark aesthetic with all visual effects described in this guide: glassmorphism cards, aurora gradient backgrounds, dot matrix patterns, noise texture, and scroll-triggered animations. The site is built as a single-page application with smooth scroll navigation.

### Social Media

Social posts should maintain brand colours even in lighter formats. Use the Deep Navy (`#06080D`) as a post background with Electric Blue accent text for headlines. Carousel posts can use alternating navy and slightly lighter (`#0C1017`) slides. Always include the gradient-treated wordmark on social graphics.

**Profile images:** Gradient-filled circle with white "MAIN" text.

**Cover images:** Dark navy with aurora gradient effect and tagline.

### Eventbrite & Ticketing

Event listings should use the darkest permissible background. Feature images should be 1920×1080px minimum, using the brand aesthetic. Include the wordmark, event title in Outfit Bold, date/location in Outfit Light, and a single accent gradient element.

### Email Marketing

Emails should use a simplified version of the dark aesthetic. Deep Navy background, Off White text, Electric Blue links and CTAs. Keep glassmorphism effects minimal in email as backdrop-filter is not widely supported. Use solid dark card backgrounds (`#0C1017`) as a reliable alternative.

### Print Materials

Handouts, cheat sheets, and printed materials can invert to a light palette for readability and cost-effective printing. Use white backgrounds, Deep Navy headings, and Electric Blue accents. The gradient wordmark should be reproduced in CMYK equivalent: C:65 M:35 Y:0 K:0 (Blue) transitioning to C:70 M:0 Y:45 K:0 (Cyan).

## 10. Usage Rules & Don'ts

### Logo Don'ts

**Never** rotate, skew, distort, or add drop shadows to the wordmark.

**Never** change the gradient colours or direction on the AI letterforms.

**Never** place the wordmark on busy photographic backgrounds without a solid or semi-transparent backing.

**Never** rearrange, stack, or separate the letters of the wordmark.

**Never** recreate the wordmark in a different typeface.

### Colour Don'ts

**Never** use the brand gradient as a full-area background fill. It is reserved for accents, lines, and the wordmark.

**Never** use Electric Blue as body text on dark backgrounds — it lacks sufficient contrast. Use Off White (`#F1F5F9`) instead.

**Never** introduce new colours outside this palette without approval. Brand consistency depends on a controlled colour system.

### Typography Don'ts

**Never** use Outfit below weight 300 (Light) — thinner weights lose legibility on dark backgrounds.

**Never** use Newsreader in upright (non-italic) form. Its brand role is exclusively italic.

**Never** centre-align body text. Left-alignment maintains readability for all text blocks.

### Content Don'ts

**Never** make vendor-specific claims or endorsements without disclosure. Our trust is built on neutrality.

**Never** use jargon, buzzwords, or corporate-speak in audience-facing materials. If it wouldn't make sense to a plumber, rewrite it.

**Never** promise specific financial outcomes (e.g., "double your revenue"). Focus on practical outcomes: time saved, tools set up, skills gained.
